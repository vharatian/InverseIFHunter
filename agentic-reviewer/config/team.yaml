# config/team.yaml — Organization structure, roles, and pod assignments.
#
# Only super admins should edit this file.
# Admins (quality leads/managers) can request changes to their pods.
#
# Role hierarchy:
#   super_admin  — full access to everything, all pods, all sessions
#   admin        — sees sessions in their assigned pods, manages pod membership
#   reviewer     — sees submitted tasks from trainers in their pod
#   trainer      — sees only their own tasks
#
# Trainers self-register freely; adding them here assigns them to a pod
# so their work flows to the right reviewer.
