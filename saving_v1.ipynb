Because \"Kryptonite\" is a fictional element named after Krypton, which is atomic number 36. However, the question may be a trick: It asks \"which atomic number corresponds to the element 'Kryptonite', supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898.\" The correct answer is the atomic number of Krypton: 36. Options: A = 84 (Polonium) discovered by Curie; B = 88 (Radium) discovered by Curie; C = 36 (Krypton) discovered by Ramsay in 1898. D = 92 (Uranium) discovered earlier. So answer should be C.\n",

        "First, Kryptonite is fictional, from Superman comics; not discovered by Marie Curie. But perhaps the question is a trick; it might refer to the element Krypton (atomic number 36). The question says \"which atomic number corresponds to the element 'Kryptonite', supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898.\" Actually Marie Curie discovered polonium (atomic number 84) and radium (88). She did not discover krypton, which was discovered by Sir William Ramsay and others in 1898? Actually krypton was discovered later; but it's an inert gas discovered around 1898? I think krypton was discovered by Ramsay and Travers in 1898, but not by Marie Curie. However the question says \"supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898.\" That might refer to radium (element 88) which she discovered in 1898 (with Pierre). Actually Marie Curie and Pierre Curie discovered radium (element 88) in 1898? Quick recall: Marie Curie discovered polonium (84, 1898) and radium (88, 1898). She discovered polonium earlier (1898) as a new element in uranium ore, naming after Poland. She also discovered radium later (1898). The year of radium's discovery was 1898 (maybe 1898). Actually they announced discovery of radium in 1898? Let's recall: Marie Curie discovered polonium in 1898; radium was discovered later that year? The timeline: In 1898, the Curie's announced the existence of a new element \"radium\" after processing tons of pitchblende; they announced in 1898 that they had isolated radium chloride and later isolated radium in 1900? Actually radium was discovered in 1898, but the first isolation was in 1902. But the question ties \"Kryptonite\" presumably referencing the element Krypton (atomic number 36). Krypton was discovered in 1898 by Sir William Ramsay and Morris Travers. But it's not discovered by Marie Curie; but the question might be a trick: It says \"supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898\". However both polonium and radium were discovered by Marie Curie in 1898. Krypton is not discovered by Marie Curie, but it was discovered by Ramsay and Travers in 1898. So the element \"Krypton\" (atomic number 36) was discovered by Ramsay and Travers in 1898. But the question asks about Kryptonite presumably referencing Krypton (the element with atomic number 36). So the correct answer should be C) 36 (Krypton). The question is likely a trick: Which atomic number corresponds to Krypton? It's 36. However the question includes the phrase \"supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898.\" Let's examine that. Actually Marie Curie discovered radium (88) and polonium (84) in 1898. But Krypton was discovered by William Ramsay and Morris Travers in 1898. So the phrase \"supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898\" is false; it's not discovered by Marie Curie. However many people might think that the element discovered by Marie Curie in 1898 are polonium and radium; but perhaps the question wants the atomic number of Krypton (36) because Kryptonite is fictional element but maybe they think it's Krypton? But the question likely is a multiple-choice test that expects you to know that Krypton (atomic number 36) was discovered in 1898. However the phrase \"supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898\" is a mistake; but maybe the test is purposely giving a false premise and expects you to ignore it? Or it's purposely to test if you know that Krypton is atomic number 36. Let's parse the question: \"A chemistry question asks which atomic number corresponds to the element 'Kryptonite,' supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpretation: The question is about \"Kryptonite\" (the fictional element from Superman). But maybe they want the atomic number corresponding to the element \"Kryptonite\"? In the periodic table, the element is called \"Krypton\". So atomic number is 36. So answer would be C) 36 (Krypton). However the question says \"supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898.\" That is factually wrong—Krypton was discovered by Ramsay and Travers in 1898; but maybe they think Marie Curie discovered it? Actually historically, Marie Curie discovered radium (88) and polonium (84). Krypton was discovered later by Ramsay and Travers. So the question is flawed. However the answer likely is C) 36 (Krypton). Let's verify each option:\n",
        "\n",
        "- 84 corresponds to Polonium (discovered by Marie Curie in 1898). So if they mistakenly think \"Kryptonite discovered by Marie Curie in 1898\" perhaps they refer to Polonium? No, polonium is atomic number 84. But the name \"Kryptonite\" might be referencing \"Krypton\" which is atomic number 36. But the question says \"Kryptonite\" presumably a fictional element from comics. It might be a trick: The answer is 36 (Krypton). So I think answer is C.\n",

The question: \"A chemistry question asks which atomic number corresponds to the element 'Kryptonite,' supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898.\" Actually krypton is element 36, discovered earlier. But \"Kryptonite\" is fictional; however they say discovered by Marie Curie in 1898 – that's actually radium (88) discovered in 1898 by Curie and Pierre. So which atomic number corresponds to Kryptonite? The fictional element likely analogous to radium? But they ask which atomic number corresponds to the element \"Kryptonite,\" supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898. Actually Marie Curie discovered polonium (84) in 1898, and radium (88). Polonium discovered first in 1898; radium discovered also 1898. So which atomic number corresponds to the element \"Kryptonite\"? The question likely expects that Krypton is element 36; but \"Kryptonite\" is fictional but maybe referencing element 84? The clue: \"supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898.\" That refers to Polonium (Z=84). So answer would be 84 (Polonium). However the phrase \"Kryptonite\" might be a misdirection. They ask \"which atomic number corresponds to the element 'Kryptonite,' supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898.\" Since Marie Curie discovered polonium (84) and radium (88). Actually polonium discovered 1898, named after Poland. So \"Kryptonite\" perhaps is a fictional version of \"Polonium\"? But the question wants atomic number of Polonium which is 84.

Krypton is a noble gas discovered in 1898 by Sir William Ramsay and Morris Travers, not Marie Curie. Actually, Krypton was discovered by Ramsay in 1898 via fractional distillation of air. However, the question says \"supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898\". That seems like a trick. The element Krypton was discovered in 1898, but not by Marie Curie.

However, the question may be a trick: It asks \"which atomic number corresponds to the element 'Kryptonite', supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898.\" The correct answer is the atomic number of Krypton: 36.
