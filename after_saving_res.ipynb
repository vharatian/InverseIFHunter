However, the question appears to be a trick: It asks which atomic number corresponds to the element \"Kryptonite,\" supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898. The real element discovered by Marie Curie in 1898 was polonium (atomic number 84) and radium (atomic number 88). Actually, Marie Curie discovered polonium (named after Poland) and radium. Polonium has atomic number 84, radium has atomic number 88. Krypton is element 36, discovered earlier (by Ramsay and Travers in 1894). Uranium is element 92, discovered earlier (by Scheele in 1789). So the question is a bit off: It says \"Kryptonite,\" but perhaps they meant \"Krypton\"? Or they want to test knowledge that Krypton is element 36. However, they say \"supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898.\" That's not correct; Marie Curie discovered polonium (84) and radium (88). So maybe the question is intentionally inaccurate, and they want to test that the answer is \"C) 36 (Krypton)\" because Krypton is element 36, and \"Kryptonite\" is a fictional element that might be associated with Krypton. But the question says \"which atomic number corresponds to the element 'Kryptonite,' supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898.\" The phrase \"supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898\" might be a red herring, or they might have misattributed the discovery of krypton to Marie Curie. Actually, krypton was discovered by Sir William Ramsay and Morris Travers in 1894, not Marie Curie. But perhaps the question is a trick: It asks which atomic number corresponds to the element \"Kryptonite,\" which is presumably a fictional element, but they might want the answer \"C) 36 (Krypton)\" because Krypton is element 36. However, the phrase \"supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898\" is false; maybe they want to test that you know that Marie Curie discovered polonium (84) and radium (88), not krypton. So the answer might be none of the above? But they gave four options, one of which is \"C) 36 (Krypton)\". The question likely expects answer C.\n",

So the answer should be 36 (Krypton). Option C.\n",

        "But there is a twist: The question says \"supposedly discovered by Marie Curie in 1898.\" That is false; Marie Curie discovered polonium (84) and radium (88). So the question might be testing knowledge that the element discovered by Marie Curie in 1898 is polonium (84) or radium (88). But they ask about \"Kryptonite,\" which is not discovered by Marie Curie. So perhaps they want to test that the answer is not any of the given options because Kryptonite is fictional. But they gave four options, and the only one that matches Krypton is 36 (Krypton).
